    <h2>Custom blocks and items for <a href="https://papermc.io">Paper</a></h2>
</div>

Origami is a Minecraft server plugin which allows a server admin to easily add configurable custom
blocks,
items and crafting recipes using YAML configuration files.

The plugin generates and hosts resource packs to allow **vanilla** clients to connect and play with your custom content.
